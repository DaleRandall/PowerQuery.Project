# Power Query in PowerBI Project

The Global Superstore data was uploaded into Power BI and transformed using Power Query to create a clean, structured dataset suitable for data analysis. The data was then used to create a visual representation in Power BI, providing valuable insights into various metrics related to the Global Superstore's sales and operations.

The Power Query was used to clean and transform the data, including removing duplicates, correcting errors, and creating new columns to categorize data for analysis. The visual created in Power BI showcased various aspects of the business, such as sales by region, product category, and customer demographics.

The visual created was designed to be intuitive and interactive, enabling users to explore the data and uncover insights easily. The visual includes a range of charts, tables, and graphs, displaying information in a clear and concise format. The insights generated from the visual can be used to inform strategic decision-making, optimize sales, and improve operational efficiency in the Global Superstore.

Overall, the use of Power Query and Power BI allowed for the creation of a powerful visual representation of the Global Superstore's data, providing valuable insights into sales and operations that can be used to drive business success.
